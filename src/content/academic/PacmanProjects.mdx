Course: CS471 - Intro to Artificial Intelligence

Achieved near 100% success rate across varied Pac-Man game scenarios by leveraging a variety of intelligent search, planning, and decision-making strategies  

- Applied Minimax tree search to model adversarial ghost behavior and minimize worst-case outcomes. 
- Extended Minimax to Expectimax for modeling probabilistic ghost behavior, incorporating Alpha-Beta pruning to reduce computational overhead. 
- Trained Q-learning and Approximate Q-learning agents to achieve optimal action selection even in large state spaces.  
- Used Hidden Markov Models and Bayesian Networks to model partially observed ghost behavior and uncertain environment dynamics, improving performance at more difficult levels.
