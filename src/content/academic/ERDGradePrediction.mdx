# Overview

I led a team of five to develop a system that predicts student grades in Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) assignments based on their submission content. Given a training set of ERD submissions and their corresponding human-assigned grades, we were tasked with predicting the grades of ERD submissions without known grades. First, we vectorized the ERDs using a combination of hand-selected features and graph similarity metrics. Then, we trained and tuned a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model to predict grades based on these vectors.

# My Contributions

- Implemented modular KNN regression model with K-tuning using a line-chart and dendrogram. 
- Implemented Approach 4 (Feature Engineering + Custom Similarity Function) 
    - Extracts features like number of entities, relationships, attributes, and various ratios to create a feature vector for each ERD submission. 
    - Predict grades based on weighted similarity of these feature vectors using KNN regression.
- Implemented scripts for hyperparameter tuning using Optuna to optimize custom similarity function weights. 
- Wrote the main runner script, combining all components to pre-process the input JSON's, encode the ERDs, and generate grade predictions.

# Final Presentation:
This presentation only includes Approach 3 (Graph Similarity + Text Encoding) and Approach 4 (Feature Engineering), which were the best performing. I presented the hyperparameter tuning, K-tuning, and the demo at the end.
