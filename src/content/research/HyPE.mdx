# Summary
I’m conducting research in model-based meta-reinforcement learning, focused on designing better model selection strategies for fast task adaptation. Our goal is to outperform existing methods like FAMLE, which rely on random exploration. We’re experimenting with a novel selection method that uses hypothesis-based decision making to prioritize informative rollouts over randomness. I’ve contributed heavily to experimental design, test coverage (via Pytest), and training + evaluation infrastructure. Many experiment configurations and implementation details were my own. While results are still developing, this work has sharpened my ability to navigate complex RL pipelines, debug under uncertainty, and iterate quickly. We aim to publish by the end of 2025 and are excited about advancing data-efficient meta-RL through smarter exploration**.**
