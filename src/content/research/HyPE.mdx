# Summary
[Hypothesis Planned Exploration (HyPE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03701) is a novel approach to exploration in meta-reinforcement learning. Given the same sample budget, our method successfully adapts four times more often than the standard passive strategy. I’ve contributed heavily to experimental design, test coverage (via Pytest), and training + evaluation infrastructure. We are currently under review for publication at IJCAI 2026. Additional work is ongoing with plans to submit to NeurIPS 2026.
