# Summary
[Hypothesis Planned Exploration (HyPE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03701) is a novel approach to exploration in meta-reinforcement learning. Given the same sample budget, our method successfully adapts four times more often than the standard passive strategy in Natural Language Alchemy, a modified version of [Alchemy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02926). We are currently under review for publication at IJCAI 2026. Additional work exploring approximations of Bayes-optimal policies is ongoing with plans to submit to NeurIPS 2026.
