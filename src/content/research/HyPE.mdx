# Summary
[Hypothesis Planned Exploration (HyPE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03701) is a novel approach to exploration in model-based meta-reinforcement learning. Using a joint latent space, the agent selects actions that maximize information gain about the environment, thereby requiring only a few samples to distinguish the task at hand. In our experiments, it performed 4x better than the baseline. 

Iâ€™ve contributed heavily to experimental design, test coverage (via Pytest), and training + evaluation infrastructure. This work has sharpened my ability to navigate complex RL pipelines, debug under uncertainty, and iterate quickly.
