# Summary
[Hypothesis Network Planned Exploration (HyPE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03701) is a novel approach to exploration in model-based meta-reinforcement learning. It uses a hypothesis network to generate and evaluate potential future trajectories, allowing the agent to select actions that maximize information gain about the environment. This method aims to improve sample efficiency and task adaptation speed compared to traditional random exploration strategies.

Iâ€™ve contributed heavily to experimental design, test coverage (via Pytest), and training + evaluation infrastructure. This work has sharpened my ability to navigate complex RL pipelines, debug under uncertainty, and iterate quickly.
