# Overview
Listly is a CLI utility for organizing todo lists with Vim-like keybindings. You can create and manage different lists with CLI commands and make changes to tasks within them with Vim-style keybindings in a TUI. Listly takes inspiration from Git's branching with respect to switching between and editing different todo lists (not the VC part).

Each todo list resembles a Git branch: there is always a current list that you're working on (unless you have no lists), similar to how Git always has a current branch checked out. Commands that operate on the “current list” implicitly affect this active list unless another list is explicitly specified.

This design allows seamless switching between multiple task contexts, enabling context-based task management or project-specific lists without losing track of your progress elsewhere. You can create new lists, switch between them, and keep tasks organized across different areas of your work or life while staying efficient with intuitive CLI commands and natural Vim-style keybindings.

Listly also includes a Google Gemini powered list generation feature that can create task lists based on a project description passed in via a text file.
